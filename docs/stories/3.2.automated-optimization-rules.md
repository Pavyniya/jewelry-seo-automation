### **Component Specifications** [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]
**Key Automation Components:**
- **RuleBuilder**: Visual rule creation interface
- **RuleTemplates**: Pre-built optimization templates
- **WorkflowDesigner**: Complex workflow creation tool
- **RulePerformance**: Rule effectiveness dashboard
- **ApprovalQueue**: Pending action approval interface
- **RuleHistory**: Execution history and audit trail
- **TemplateManager**: Template creation and management

**Component Architecture:**
```typescript
// pages/automation/Rules.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useAutomationStore } from '@/stores/automationStore';
import { RuleBuilder } from '@/components/automation/RuleBuilder';
import { RuleTemplates } from '@/components/automation/RuleTemplates';
import { RulePerformance } from '@/components/automation/RulePerformance';
import { ApprovalQueue } from '@/components/automation/ApprovalQueue';

export const AutomationRules: React.FC = () => {
  const {
    rules,
    templates,
    performance,
    pendingApprovals,
    createRule,
    executeRule
  } = useAutomationStore();

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Automation Rules</h1>
        <button
          onClick={() => {/* Open rule builder */}}
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700"
        >
          Create Rule
        </button>
      </div>

      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
        <div className="lg:col-span-2">
          <RuleBuilder
            onSave={createRule}
            templates={templates}
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          <RulePerformance performance={performance} />
        </div>
      </div>

      <ApprovalQueue
        approvals={pendingApprovals}
        onApprove={(id) => {/* Handle approval */}}
        onReject={(id, reason) => {/* Handle rejection */}}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```
