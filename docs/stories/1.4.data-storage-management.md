# Story 1.4: Basic Data Storage and Management

## **Status**

Complete

## **Story**

**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement local data storage for products and generated content,
**so that** I can manage the optimization workflow efficiently.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1: SQLite database schema designed for products, content versions, and optimization history
2: Data models implemented for product information and SEO content
3: Database operations with proper error handling and validation
4: Basic data query and management functionality working
5: Data backup and export capabilities established
