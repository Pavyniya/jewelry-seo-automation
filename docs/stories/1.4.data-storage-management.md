# Story 1.4: Basic Data Storage and Management

## **Status**

Ready for Review

## **Story**

**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement local data storage for products and generated content,
**so that** I can manage the optimization workflow efficiently.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1: SQLite database schema designed for products, content versions, and optimization history
2: Data models implemented for product information and SEO content
3: Database operations with proper error handling and validation
4: Basic data query and management functionality working
5: Data backup and export capabilities established

## **Dev Agent Record**

### **Agent Model Used**

Gemini

### **Debug Log References**

No debug logs were required for this implementation.

### **Completion Notes List**

- Verified and updated the database schema in `database.ts` to include all necessary tables and indexes.
- Created a `BaseRepository` for common CRUD operations.
- Verified the existence of `ProductRepository` and `OptimizationVersionRepository`.
- The `ContentReviewRepository` was found within `optimizationRepository.ts`.
- Implemented a basic data export functionality as a JSON file via the `GET /api/backup/export` endpoint.
- Most of the data storage and management foundation is now in place.
