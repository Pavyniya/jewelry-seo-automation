# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Configuration

## **Status**

Ready for Review

## **Story**

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the development environment with proper configuration management,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the SEO automation system.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

2: Environment configuration system established for API keys and settings
3: Git repository created with proper .gitignore for sensitive data
4: Development and production environment configurations defined
5: Basic project structure with organized folders for models, routes, services, and utilities

## **Dev Notes**

### **Previous Story Insights**
No previous stories - this is the foundational story for the project.

### **Data Models**
No specific data models required for this setup story.

### **API Specifications**
No API endpoints required for this setup story.

### **Component Specifications**
No UI components required for this setup story.

### **File Locations**
Based on the defined monorepo structure [Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]:
- Root: `/jewelry-seo-automation/`
- Frontend app: `/apps/web/`
- Backend app: `/apps/api/`
- Shared packages: `/packages/shared/`
- Configuration files at root level
- Documentation in `/docs/`

### **Testing Requirements**
No specific testing requirements for this setup story. Basic tooling setup will be completed.

### **Technical Constraints**
- **Node.js Version**: >= 18.0.0 [Source: architecture.md#development-workflow]
- **Package Manager**: pnpm >= 8.0.0 [Source: architecture.md#development-workflow]
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.0+ for both frontend and backend [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Monorepo Tool**: pnpm workspaces [Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js 4.19+ [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18.3+ [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

### **Critical Development Rules** [Source: architecture.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Type Sharing**: Always define types in packages/shared and import from there
- **Environment Variables**: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- **Error Handling**: All API routes must use the standard error handler

### **Project Structure Notes**
The architecture defines a monorepo structure with clear separation between frontend, backend, and shared code. The setup must establish this foundation with proper workspace configuration and folder organization.

## **Testing**

- **Test Location**: No specific tests required for this setup story
- **Test Standards**: Will be established in subsequent stories
- **Testing Framework**: Jest + Vitest + Playwright to be configured in future stories
- **Test Requirements**: Basic testing tooling setup will be prepared but not implemented

## **Change Log**

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2025-09-25 | v1.0 | Initial story creation based on PRD and Architecture | Bob (Scrum Master) |
