### **Previous Story Insights**
Story 4.1 established the testing foundation. This story creates the deployment infrastructure that ensures reliable, automated releases with proper monitoring and rollback capabilities.

### **Infrastructure Architecture** [Source: architecture.md#deployment-strategy]
**Environment Structure:**
```hcl
# terraform/main.tf
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
    railway = {
      source  = "railwayapp/railway"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

# Development Environment
module "dev_environment" {
  source = "./modules/environment"
  environment = "dev"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  database_size = "db.t3.micro"
  auto_scaling = false
}

### **Deployment Strategies** [Source: architecture.md#deployment-strategy]
**Blue-Green Deployment:**
```yaml
# railway.service.yml
database:
  engine: "sqlite"
  migrations:
    command: "pnpm migrate:latest"
    rollback: "pnpm migrate:rollback"

deploy:
  healthCheckPath: "/health"
  sleepBeforeDestroy: 30
  autoRollback: true

  # Blue-green deployment
  strategy: "blue-green"
  routing:
    - path: "/*"
      service: "primary"
      weight: 100
    - path: "/*"
      service: "canary"
      weight: 0

  # Canary deployment
  canary:
    enabled: true
    weight: 10
    duration: "30m"
    metrics:
      - error_rate < 0.01
      - response_time < 500
      - success_rate > 0.99
```

### **Monitoring Configuration** [Source: architecture.md#monitoring]
**Application Monitoring:**
```typescript
// apps/api/src/monitoring/monitoring.ts
import * as Prometheus from 'prom-client';
import { Logger } from 'winston';

export class ApplicationMonitoring {
  private logger: Logger;
  private metrics: Prometheus.Registry;

  constructor() {
    this.logger = this.createLogger();
    this.metrics = new Prometheus.Registry();
    this.setupMetrics();
  }

  private setupMetrics() {
    // HTTP request metrics
    const httpRequestDuration = new Prometheus.Histogram({
      name: 'http_request_duration_seconds',
      help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in seconds',
      labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code']
    });

    // Database query metrics
    const dbQueryDuration = new Prometheus.Histogram({
      name: 'db_query_duration_seconds',
      help: 'Duration of database queries in seconds',
      labelNames: ['operation', 'table']
    });

    // Business metrics
    const optimizationJobs = new Prometheus.Counter({
      name: 'optimization_jobs_total',
      help: 'Total number of optimization jobs processed',
      labelNames: ['status', 'provider']
    });

    this.metrics.registerMetric(httpRequestDuration);
    this.metrics.registerMetric(dbQueryDuration);
    this.metrics.registerMetric(optimizationJobs);
  }

  public getMetrics(): Promise<string> {
    return this.metrics.metrics();
  }
}
```

### **Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- **Deployment Testing**: Test deployment process in staging first
- **Rollback Testing**: Verify rollback procedures work correctly
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor performance after deployments
- **Security Testing**: Scan deployments for vulnerabilities
- **Smoke Testing**: Basic functionality verification post-deployment

### **Technical Constraints** [Source: architecture.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Environment Isolation**: Keep environments completely separate
- **Configuration Management**: Never hardcode environment-specific values
- **Security**: Implement proper access controls and encryption
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring for all environments
- **Backup**: Regular backups with tested restore procedures

### **Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#performance-optimization]
- **Deployment Time**: < 5 minutes for deployment completion
- **Downtime**: Zero downtime for production deployments
- **Rollback Time**: < 2 minutes for rollback completion
- **Health Check**: < 30 seconds for health check verification
- **Auto-scaling**: Respond to load changes within 2 minutes

### **Security Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#security-requirements]
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to deployment systems
- **Secret Management**: Secure storage and rotation of secrets
- **Network Security**: Firewall configuration and security groups
- **Compliance**: Regular security audits and compliance checks
- **Incident Response**: Documented incident response procedures

### **Project Structure Notes**
The deployment pipeline must ensure reliable, automated releases with comprehensive monitoring and rollback capabilities. Infrastructure as Code provides reproducibility while maintaining security and performance requirements.

## **Deployment Implementation**

- **Infrastructure**: Terraform-managed AWS and Railway infrastructure
- **Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and security scanning
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive application and infrastructure monitoring
- **Security**: Regular security scanning and compliance monitoring
- **Backup**: Automated backup and disaster recovery procedures
