# Jewelry SEO Automation Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## **Section 1: Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**
- Automate jewelry store SEO optimization to increase organic search traffic
- Save 25+ hours of manual content creation and optimization work
- Establish consistent, professional brand voice across entire product catalog
- Create scalable system for growing jewelry business with NZ market focus
- Reduce dependency on paid advertising through organic growth

### **Background Context**
The Ohh Glam jewelry store currently faces significant challenges with organic search visibility and manual SEO workload. As a stainless steel jewelry business targeting professional women in New Zealand, the store has minimal organic traffic and spends excessive time on manual content optimization. The business operates in a competitive jewelry market with strong search demand, creating a significant opportunity for automated, jewelry-specific SEO optimization. With products positioned as accessible luxury (NZ$49-100 range) featuring 316L stainless steel, hypoallergenic, and waterproof properties, there's a clear need for efficient, brand-consistent content that resonates with the target audience of professional women seeking beach-to-boardroom versatility. The high risk tolerance due to low current organic traffic creates an ideal environment for aggressive experimentation with AI-powered automation.

### **Accessibility: WCAG AA**
Ensure full accessibility compliance with WCAG AA standards, including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, and clear visual hierarchy. This is essential for professional business applications and inclusive design.

### **Branding**
The interface should embody Ohh Glam's brand aesthetic: clean, modern, and professional with a touch of elegance. Use a refined color palette that reflects the stainless steel jewelry aesthetic - metallic accents, clean whites, and sophisticated grays. Typography should be professional yet approachable, mirroring the brand's "accessible luxury" positioning.

### **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**
The dashboard must be fully responsive across all device sizes, with primary focus on desktop usage for detailed content review work, while maintaining full functionality on tablets for on-the-go management. Mobile compatibility for basic monitoring and quick approvals.
