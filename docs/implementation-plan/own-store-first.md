## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

### **Step 1: Data Extraction**

const products = await shopifyAPI.getProducts();
const productData = products.map(p => ({
  id: p.id,
  title: p.title,
  description: p.body_html,
  type: p.product_type,
  tags: p.tags,
  price: p.variants[0].price
}));
```

### **Step 2: Content Generation**

// Generate optimized content for each product
for (const product of products) {
  const optimizedContent = await aiEngine.generateContent({
    product,
    template: jewelryPromptTemplate,
    market: 'NZ'
  });

  // Save to database
  await database.saveOptimizedContent(product.id, optimizedContent);
}
```

### **Step 3: Quality Review**
```javascript
// Human review interface
function reviewContent(productId, generatedContent) {
  // Display original vs. optimized content
  // Allow manual editing
  // Approve or request regeneration
}
```

### **Step 4: Shopify Update**
```javascript
// Push approved content to Shopify
async function updateShopifyProduct(productId, optimizedContent) {
  await shopifyAPI.updateProduct(productId, {
    title: optimizedContent.seoTitle,
    body_html: optimizedContent.description,
    metafields: [
      {
